# Snapshot an Azure VM Disk using PowerShell

**There are 3 objectives with this lab:**
* Stop the Virtual Machine
* Take a Snapshot of the VM
* Copy the Snapshot to Container


## Stop the Virtual Machine

In the first part of the lab, we need to create our new storage account. We've been through this plenty of times so go create a new storage account. I named mine `evstorageaccount5` and clicked create.

That completes the first half of this lab!



## Take a Snapshot of the VM

For the second portion of this lab, we're going to actually start doing the backups. So firstly, lets go into the pre-configured storage account. Lets navigate to the file share that we are attempting to backup to our new file share, `fileshare1`.

## Copy the Snapshot to Container


Lab completed!

## Personal Notes

Another straightforward lab. It was nice seeing another way of backing up data. You can never be too careful!
